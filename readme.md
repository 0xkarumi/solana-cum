# `solana-cum üçç`

cum library for solana

## why

solana is like a next gen programmable database.
a bunch of cool shit is on it like [pyth] and [zeta markets].

devs were kinda lazy so there is only 4 databases running: devnet, testnet, mainnet, pythnet.
too many people came and solano crashed so they added compute units to triage who can use it.

solana has like a billion cu per second but jump and alameda is using all of them to liquidate your apes bozo

so cum (compute unit minimizing) makes your programs run faster and more healthy

  [pyth]: https://pyth.network/
  [zeta markets]: https://zeta.markets/

## how

these are the best ways to cum:
- wrap everything in unsafe blocks
- use inline assembly wherever you can
- jerk each other off on ct
- add rationalizing comments for your post-nut-clarity-self
- checked math is for virgins

(credit to the eth hoes for teaching me these techniques)
